# Security-Audit-Botium-Toys
I conducted a security audit for Botium Toys, assessing their IT infrastructure, data security, compliance status, and overall risk exposure. My audit covered employee equipment, internal networks, software systems, data storage, and legacy system maintenance.  

Through my risk assessment, I identified critical security gaps, including weak access controls, lack of encryption, inadequate monitoring, and missing disaster recovery plans. I also evaluated compliance with PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC frameworks, highlighting areas where Botium Toys falls short.  

Finally, I provided recommendations to improve security, such as implementing least privilege access, encrypting sensitive data, deploying an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), setting up backups, and enforcing stronger password policies. My report serves as a roadmap for Botium Toys to enhance their security posture and meet industry compliance standards.
